- Create recipes based on provided ingredients and preferences.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following:

- Java 17 or higher.
- Maven or Gradle for dependency management.
- A configured and running backend service for the `OpenAI` and `Spring Web` dependencies.

### Open API Key
  - Step 1: Sign in to OpenAI
    - Go to the OpenAI website.
    - Click on the Sign In button (top-right corner).
    - Enter your credentials (email and password) or log in using a third-party service (e.g., Google, Microsoft).
  - Step 2: Access the API Section

         - Once logged in to the API dashboard, click on your profile icon (top-right corner).
         - Select API Keys from the dropdown menu.
  - Step 4: Generate a New API Key
      - In the API Keys section, click the Create New Secret Key button.
      - Copy the generated API key. You won’t be able to view it again once you close this page.
      - Save the key securely in a password manager or a secure file.
